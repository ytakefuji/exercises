# 1. Sweden prediction using curve-fitting
<a href='https://github.com/ytakefuji/sweden'> Sweden prediction</a>

Use numpy.polyfit function for prediction.

Hints: np.polyfit(x,y,z) where x and y are input and output with the zth degree of polinomial.

$ python swedendaily.py

# 2. Prediction for any country using the curve-fitting

Make a program for prediction by entering a country name.

$ python daily.py


# 3. Europe prediction using curve-fitting

You should convert euro.xlsx to euro.csv where euro.xlsx was downloaded from:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102288/coronavirus-deaths-development-europe/

Note that all integers must be converted to proper integers, for example, "1,234" to 1234 in euro.csv file.

Use numpy.polyfit function for prediction using converted euro.csv.
